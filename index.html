  <h2> Habitat </h2>
  <p>
    The habitat of the passenger pigeon was mixed hardwood forests. <br>
    The birds depended on the huge forests for their
    spring nesting sites, for winter "roosts," and for food.

  <h2> Characteristics </h2>
  <p>
    The passenger pigeon was much larger than the somewhat similarly plumed mourning dove. <br>
    Adapted for speed and maneuverability in flight, it had a small head and neck; long tail; long, broad and pointed wings; and particularly
    large breast muscles that enabled it to fly for long distances.
