  <h2 id="Habitat">Habitat</h2>
  <p>
    The habitat of the passenger pigeon was mixed hardwood forests. <br>
    The birds depended on the huge forests for their
    spring nesting sites, for winter "roosts," and for food.<br>
    <br>
    The passenger pigeon's primary habitat was in eastern deciduous forests, with strong beeches and oak trees most fitted for nesting and roosting. The pigeon preferred to winter in large swamps, particularly those with alder trees; if swamps were not available, forested areas, particularly with pine trees, were favored roosting sites.<br>
    <br>
    The passenger pigeon was found across most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. It originally bred from the southern parts of eastern and central Canada south to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Georgia, but the primary breeding range was in southern Ontario and the Great Lakes states south through states north of the Appalachian Mountains.

  <h2 id="Characteristics"> Characteristics </h2>
  <p>
    The passenger pigeon was much larger than the somewhat similarly plumed mourning dove. <br>
    Adapted for speed and maneuverability in flight, it had a small head and neck; long tail; long, broad and pointed wings; and particularly
    large breast muscles that enabled it to fly for long distances. This bird had red eyes, a black bill and red feet. <br>
    <br>The male had a red breast and blue-gray head, body and wings. <br>
    <br>The female had a more brownish body and its lower throat and breast were a buff-gray that developed into white on the belly.

  <h2 id="Diet">Diet</h2>
  <p>
 In the fall, winter and spring, this bird mainly ate beechnuts, acorns and chestnuts. During the summer it ate mainly berries and berries and softer fruits such as the fruit of dogwoods. It also ate earthworms, caterpillars and snails, particularly while breeding — in addition to cultivated grains, particularly buckwheat, when it found them. <br>
 <br>The species was particularly fond of salt, which it ingested either from brackish springs or salty soil. The bird foraged in flocks of tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals that overturned leaves, dirt, and snow with their bills in a frantic search for nuts.

  <p>
    About September 1, 1914, the last known passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was roughly 29 years old, with a palsy that made her tremble. Not once in her life had she laid a fertile egg.<br>
    <br>Her body was frozen into a block of ice and sent to the Smithsonian Institution, where it was skinned, dissected, photographed and mounted. Currently, Martha is in the museum's archived collection and not on display. A memorial statue of Martha stands on the grounds of the Cincinnati Zoo.

      <h2 id="The Extinction">The Extinction</h2>
      <p>
        The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon had three significant causes: <br>
          1. Overhunted <br>
          2. Loss of habitat <br>
          3. Deforestation<br> 

          <br>The passenger pigeon went extinct due to overhunting. 
          The opening of transcontinental railroads allowed for the quick transport of hunters and their products. They were also hunted mercilessly by farmers trying to protect their crops from complete devastation.
          <br>
      <br>It was hunting and deforestation combined that are to blame for the disappearance of the passenger pigeon. Some scientists have tried to prove that these pigeons were already in decline before hunting took place. Genetic evidence points to a thriving population.

     <br>
     <br>
     <br>Even when passenger pigeons became harder to find, they were still hunted relentlessly. Their nests were also destroyed. Hunters kept at it until they were completely gone.

      Passenger pigeons weren’t able to adapt fast enough to a mass murder event. These pigeons were also highly social and nested together, making them easy targets.
      
     <br>
     <br> The way they conducted themselves as a population made their extinction easier. They nested and roosted in huge groups in forests. As deforestation progressed, it was the last blow needed to drive the passenger pigeon to extinction.
