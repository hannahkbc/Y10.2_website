  <h2 id="Habitat">Habitat</h2>
  <p>
    The habitat of the passenger pigeon was mixed hardwood forests. <br>
    The birds depended on the huge forests for their
    spring nesting sites, for winter "roosts," and for food.<br>
    <br>
    The passenger pigeon's primary habitat was in eastern deciduous forests, with strong beeches and oak trees most fitted for nesting and roosting. The pigeon preferred to winter in large swamps, particularly those with alder trees; if swamps were not available, forested areas, particularly with pine trees, were favored roosting sites.<br>
    <br>
    The passenger pigeon was found across most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. It originally bred from the southern parts of eastern and central Canada south to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Georgia, but the primary breeding range was in southern Ontario and the Great Lakes states south through states north of the Appalachian Mountains.

  <p>
    The passenger pigeon was much larger than the somewhat similarly plumed mourning dove. <br>
    Adapted for speed and maneuverability in flight, it had a small head and neck; long tail; long, broad and pointed wings; and particularly
    large breast muscles that enabled it to fly for long distances.

  <h2 id="Diet">Diet</h2>
  <p>
 In the fall, winter and spring, this bird mainly ate beechnuts, acorns and chestnuts. During the summer it ate mainly berries and berries and softer fruits such as the fruit of dogwoods. It also ate earthworms, caterpillars and snails, particularly while breeding â€” in addition to cultivated grains, particularly buckwheat, when it found them. <br>
 <br>The species was particularly fond of salt, which it ingested either from brackish springs or salty soil. The bird foraged in flocks of tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals that overturned leaves, dirt, and snow with their bills in a frantic search for nuts.

  <p>
    About September 1, 1914, the last known passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was roughly 29 years old, with a palsy that made her tremble. Not once in her life had she laid a fertile egg.
